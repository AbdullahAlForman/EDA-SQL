## üåü Introduction

Data analysis is at the core of decision-making in data science. This repository leverages SQL within a Jupyter Notebook to conduct a thorough exploration of a dataset stored in a SQLite database. The project showcases:

- How SQL can be integrated with Python for EDA.
- Querying, cleaning, and analyzing data directly from a SQLite database.
- Visualizing the results to gain insights.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced analyst, this project serves as a practical guide to using SQL for EDA.

## üìä Key Analysis Steps

This Notebook performs the following key steps:

1. **Database Connection**:
   - Establish a connection to the SQLite database.
   - Load and inspect the schema of the database tables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Execute SQL queries to extract data for analysis.
   - Perform filtering, grouping, and aggregation to explore trends and patterns.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Use Python visualization libraries (`matplotlib` and `seaborn`) to plot and interpret results.

4. **Insight Generation**:
   - Identify key takeaways and actionable insights from the data.
